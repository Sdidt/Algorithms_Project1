Some test cases are included in the TEST_FILES folder: bacterium.fna, snail.fna,
wuhan.fasta and sea_squirt.fna. 

The fastaparser module will be required to run this program. It can be installed by executing:

pip install fastaparser

in a standard shell. 

Alternative, simply run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

in a standard shell.

The program can be tested out by running the main.py file. When prompted to input the genome and pattern yourself, input "n", to specify
the path to a fasta/fna file, otherwise input anything to feed in your own input of genome and pattern.
